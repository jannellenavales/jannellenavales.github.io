This week, I mostly brainstormed ideas for dashboards and looked up examples of R Markdown files. Unfortunately, R studio does not support flexdashboard yet.

Looking at D3.js charts, Shiny, and ggplot2, here are some differences between the 3:
1. D3.js is a library that allows for the widest range of interactive and animated visualizations. However, it is perhaps the most difficult to learn.
2. Shiny is good for creating dashboards, which can also be highly interactive. Unlike D3.js, Shiny is based in R and is much easier to learn.
3. GGPlot2 is used to create static, not animated visualizations, which can be a disadvantage for some. However, of the 3 types, they are the easiest to use.
